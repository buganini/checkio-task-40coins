    <i>There are 100 coins, 99 of which are confirmed as genuine and identical. In out lot of coins, it's possible to coin dealer gave us a fake. It is not known whether the fake is heavier or lighter than the real coins. Tthe balance is restricted and may only be used 5 times to determine if there is a unique (read: fake) coin. If we find one. we will isolate it and determine its weight relative to the real coins.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A balance (which is a coroutine/generator that returns the result of the balance.)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Working with the balance: </strong>
Send a tuple (left, right) of two sets of integers to the balance.<br />
Left is a list which contains the indices of coins you want to put on the left side of the balance.<br />
Right is a list which the indices of coins you want to put on the right side of the balance.<br />
The indices of coins range from 1 to 100.<br />
The balance will yield -1 if the coins on the left side is heavier.<br />
The balance will yield 1 if the coins on the right side is heavier.<br />
The balance will yield 0 if the weight on the both side are the same.<br />
The balance will only work for 5 weighs.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Int</br>
If all 100 coins are identical, the output is 0.<br />
Otherwise, suppose the index of the different coin is i.<br />
Return i if i is heavier.<br />
Return -i if i is lighter.<br />
